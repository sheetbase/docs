# The Sheetbase CLI

Sheetbase apps are created and developed primarily through the Sheetbase command-line utility. The Sheetbase CLI is the preferred method of installation, as it offers a wide range of dev tools and help options along the way.

## Install the Sheetbase CLI

Before proceeding, make sure the latest version of Node.js and npm are installed. See Environment Setup for details. Install the Sheetbase CLI globally with npm:

```sh
$ npm install -g @sheetbase/cli
```

## Start a project

Create a Sheetbase project using one of the pre-made themes, see themes list: <https://sheetbase.net/themes>. Get started with the sheetbase start command:

```sh
$ sheetbase start myapp
```
