# Environment Setup

To get started with Sheetbase, the only requirement is a Node & npm environment.

Of course, you will also need an editor. We recommend VS Code, a free, batteries-included text editor made by Microsoft.

## Node & npm

Almost all tooling for modern JavaScript projects is based in **Node.js**. The [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page has prebuilt installation packages for all platforms. We recommend selecting the LTS version to ensure best compatibility.

Node is bundled with **npm**, the package manager for JavaScript.

To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:

```sh
node --version
npm --version
```

## Git

Git is required for publishing the frontend to Gihub Pages, the version control system Git is highly recommended. First, install the command-line utility from the [download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) page.

To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:

```sh
git --version
```
