# Start a project

Starting a new Sheetbase project is incredibly simple. From the command line, run the `sheetbase start` command and the CLI will handle the rest.

Create a Sheetbase project using one of the pre-made themes, see themes list: <https://sheetbase.net/themes>. Get started with the sheetbase start command:

```sh
sheetbase start myapp
```

The command will create a project with the [Blank Angular](https://sheetbase.net/theme/blank-angular) theme. See more themes: <https://sheetbase.net/themes>.
